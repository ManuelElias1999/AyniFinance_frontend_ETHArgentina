<h1>README.md Generator</h1>
<p>Readme.md generator is a React application that takes basic information about the user's project as an input and generates a README file which the user can upload directly in their project's repository.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>For people who are starting and uploading their very first project on a GitHub repository, are often unaware about the importance of a README file. A README file is very important for a user to justify their work and also for other people who are trying to understand their project.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>They are not familiar with the syntax and rules of the markdown language to create and edit their markdown files on GitHub. As a result, they often avoid making one and just upload their projects without a README file.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>To solve this issue, we made a React application that will take in the basic information about the user's GitHub project and create a README file for them that they can upload directly in their project's repository.</li>
